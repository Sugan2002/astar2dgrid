# A* Path Finding Algorithm for 2D Grid World
## AIM

To develop a code to find the route from the source to the destination point using A* algorithm for 2D grid world.

## THEORY
Explain the problem statement

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Build a 2D grid world with initial state , goal state and obstacles:

### STEP 2:


### STEP -> Write your own steps:


## Draw the 2D 

## PROGRAM

```python

%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random
import math
import sys
from collections import defaultdict, deque, Counter
from itertools import combinations
import heapq
```

## OUTPUT:

Explain the Completeness and complexity of the algorithm:

## RESULT:
